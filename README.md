# Amazon Vine Analysis

# Purpose

This project examines the Amazon Vine program to see if there is a bias toward positive reviews from Vine members. The analysis uses PySpark, and in this case we are using  the Google Collaborate platform, to perform the ETL process of extracting the dataset, transforming the data, and connecting to an Amazon Web Services (AWS) RDS. Finally, depending of the transformed data would be put together into pgAdmin to calculate various values.

# Dispute
 
As I sort the data set in Google Collaborate platform once more, here's a sample of working with Spark DataFrames and Functions. 

# Results
